<p>You can download on the Files signet:<br />- The <strong>public data</strong> in AutoML format. <br />- The <strong>starting kit</strong>, containing a example notebook to open the files, run baseline models and save the <strong>submission files</strong>. You can also find example of submission files in the starting kit (with random solution).</p>
<p>The data samples have 16 attributes. The target to be predicted is whether the patient will have a heart attack or not (encoded as 0 or 1).</p>
<p>The data you are provided with consists of the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>heart_attack_feat.name: Name of the 16 attributes (features).</li>
<li>heart_attack_label.name: Name of the label to be predicted (class).</li>
<li>heart_attack_train.data: Training data matrix (36000 lines x 16 columns)</li>
<li>heart_attack_train.solution: Training target values (36000 lines x 16 column)</li>
<li>heart_attack_test.data: Test data matrix (54000 lines x 16 columns)</li>
</ul>
<p>The files</p>
<pre>- classification.solution: Test target values (54000 lines x 1 column)<br />
- selection.solution: Solution on which variables are useful (16 lines x 1 column) <br />
- causality.solution: Solution on what are the causal links between variables (17 lines x 17 column)</pre>
<p>are omitted, this is what you have to predict.</p>
<p>Your submission must be a .zip archive containing the following files:<br />
- classification.csv, your predicted labels for test dataset. It should include plus or minus one values, one for each test sample, representing the class label predictions.<br />
- selection.csv, representing the features you selected as real or fake.<br />
- causality.csv, representing the causal links between variables.</p>
<p>Zip it without directory structure and submit it to Submit/View results signet.</p>
