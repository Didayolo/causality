<p>The problems are a binary classification, a feature selection and a causal inference. For the binary classification, the evaluation metric is the <strong>area under ROC curve&nbsp;</strong>(AUC). For feature selection and causality inference, the scoring metric is <strong>balanced accuracy</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It&nbsp;is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive (FPR) at various threshold settings.</p>

<p>The evaluation metric is therefore the <strong>area under the curve </strong>(AUC).</p>
