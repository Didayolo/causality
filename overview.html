<h2>Heart Attack: Causality Challenge</h2>
<p>Synthetic data about heart attack generated artificially by causal Bayesian networks with binary variables. These examples are completely made up and are used for illustration purpose only.</p>
<p>This challenge consists in <strong>three problems</strong>:
<br /><br /><strong>Binary classification:</strong> Each data row is labeled (0) or (1). You have to train a predictive model on train dataset to be able to find as well as possible the labels of the test dataset.
<br /><br /><strong>Feature selection:</strong> Among the 11 features. The goal of this problem is therefore to classify features between useless (0) and useful (1).
<br /><br /><strong>Causal inference:</strong> Find the causal links between each variables.</p>

Let's see an example:

In this example, A and C variables cause B. D has no causal links with any variable.

This can be represented by the following matrix:

<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;A&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;B&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;C&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;D&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The two arrows are represented by the 1 in the matrix.
