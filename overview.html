<h2>Lung Cancer Causality mini-challenge</h2>
<p>Toy data about lung cancer generated artificially by causal Bayesian networks with binary variables. These examples are completely made up and are used for illustration purpose only.</p>
<p>This challenge consists in <strong>three problems</strong>:
<br /><br /><strong>Binary classification:</strong> Each data row is labeled (0) or (1). You have to train a predictive model on train dataset to be able to find as well as possible the labels of the test dataset.
<br /><br /><strong>Feature selection:</strong> Among the 11 features. The goal of this problem is therefore to classify features between useless (0) and useful (1).
<br /><br /><strong>Causal feature selection:</strong> Tell which variables cause the target (1) or not (0).</p>
