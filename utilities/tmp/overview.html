<h2>CHEMS classification mini-project</h2>
<p>The chemical company, Chems-R-Us, has hired your company to consult on data analytics. Chems-R-Us' goal is to create a model to predict ready biodegradation of chemicals by using molecular descriptors. A data set of with molecular descriptors and biodegradation experimental values of 1055 chemicals were collected from the webpage of the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan (NITE). The company wants your consulting to develop a computational model to predict the ready biodegradability of molecules.</p>
<p>This challenge consists in <strong>two problems</strong>:<br /><br /><strong>Binary classification:</strong> Each data row is labeled (-1) or (1). You have to train a predictive model on train dataset to be able to find as well as possible the labels of the test dataset.<br /><br /><strong>Feature selection:</strong> Among the 168 features, there are fake features. Variables randomly generated which don't help predicting the class. The goal of this problem is therefore to classify features between fake (0) and real (1).</p>
